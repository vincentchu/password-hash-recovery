      <h2>Deployed Contracts</h2>

      <p>
        We have deployed three separate smart contracts on the main {' ' }
        Ethereum network. To facilitate testing, we have also deployed the same contracts on {' '}
        the <a href="https://www.rinkeby.io/">Rinkeby testnet</a>. Each contract is instantiated {' '}
        with the SHA1 hash of a password and some Ether as a monetary reward. Entering the correct plaintext password into the text field and submitting it will call the {' ' }
        <code>.solve(...)</code> method of the smart contract, { ' ' }
        leading to the transfer of the monetary reward to the caller. The three { ' ' }
        contracts have different difficulties, representing the difficulty of cracking each { ' ' }
        password.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Callers must pay for the gas used when submitting a guess. You can test whether or not your guess is correct, without any charge, by using the "Test" button.
